My work this year wold not have been possible without the support of those around me.
My advisor, Ray, and the rest of the Goldstein lab took me in with open arms and offered incredible amounts of their scientific wisdom. 
Out of this group, I am most indebted to Lloyd for listening to my many questions, stories, successes, and failures.

Throughout this year living abroad, several friends made me feel welcome and contributed to my unforgettable experience here, especially Nitin, Isaac, Guowei, Pavan, Jacob, and Andrew.
Thanks also to my family and friends in the US, especially my parents, Sid, Dylan, Sarah, and Gabby: I'd have felt lost abroad without the many reminders of those waiting for me at home.
